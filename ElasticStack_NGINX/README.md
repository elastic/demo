### Getting Started with ELK for NGINX Logs
This **Getting Started with ELK** example provides sample files to ingest, analyze & visualize **NGINX access logs** using the ELK stack, i.e. Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. The sample NGINX access logs in this example use the default NGINX combined log format.

##### Version
Example has been tested in following versions:
- Elasticsearch 2.0 
- Logstash 2.0
- Kibana 4.2.0

### Installation & Setup
* Follow the [Installation & Setup Guide](https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/master/Installation%20and%20Setup.md) to install and test the ELK stack (*you can skip this step if you have a working installation of the ELK stack,*)

* Run Elasticsearch & Kibana
  ```shell
    <path_to_elasticsearch_root_dir>/bin/elasticsearch
    <path_to_kibana_root_dir>/bin/kibana
    ```

* Check that Elasticsearch and Kibana are up and running.
  - Open `localhost:9200` in web browser -- should return status code 200
  - Open `localhost:5601` in web browser -- should display Kibana UI.

  **Note:** By default, Elasticsearch runs on port 9200, and Kibana run on ports 5601. If you changed the default ports, change   the above calls to use appropriate ports.

### Download Example Files

Download the following files in this repo to a local directory:
- `nginx_logs` - sample data **
- `nginx_logstash.conf` - Logstash config for ingesting data into Elasticsearch
- `nginx_template.json` - template for custom mapping of fields
- `nginx_kibana.json` - config file to load prebuilt Kibana dashboard

Unfortunately, Github does not provide a convenient one-click option to download entire contents of a subfolder in a repo. Use sample code provided below to download the required files to a local directory:

** The NGINX logs used in this example were created with the default combined `log_format` entry in the `nginx.config` file.
```
log_format combined '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                    '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                    '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"';
```

```shell
mkdir  nginx_ELK_Example
cd nginx_ELK_Example
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/ELK_NGINX/nginx_logstash.conf
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/ELK_NGINX/nginx_template.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/ELK_NGINX/nginx_kibana.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/examples/master/ELK_NGINX/nginx_logs
```

### Run Example
##### 1. Ingest data into Elasticsearch using Logstash
* Execute the following command to load sample logs into Elasticsearch.

```shell
cat nginx_logs | <path_to_logstash_root_dir>/bin/logstash -f nginx_logstash.conf
```

 * Verify that data is succesfully indexed into Elasticsearch

  Running `http://localhost:9200/nginx_elk_example/_count` should return a response a `"count":51462`

 **Note:** Included `nginx_logstash.conf` configuration file assumes that you are running Elasticsearch on the same host as     Logstash and have not changed the defaults. Modify the `host` and `cluster` settings in the `output { elasticsearch { ... } }`   section of nginx_logstash.conf, if needed.

##### 2. Visualize data in Kibana

* Access Kibana by going to `http://localhost:5601` in a web browser
* Connect Kibana to the `nginx_elk_example` index in Elasticsearch (autocreated in step 1)
    * Click the **Settings** tab >> **Indices** tab >> **Add New**. Specify `nginx_elk_example` as the index pattern name and click **Create** to define the index pattern
* Load sample dashboard into Kibana
    * Click the **Settings** tab >> **Objects** tab >> **Import**, and select `nginx_kibana.json`
* Open dashboard
    * Click on **Dashboard** tab and open `Sample Dashboard for Nginx Logs` dashboard

Voila! You should see the following dashboards. Enjoy!
